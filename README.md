## How to run the game

1. Download files from GitHub
2. Download [media files](http://qmegas.info/dark-reign-html5/media.rar) and extract them to same folder.
2. Upload all files to your site or create virtual domain (it required due to CORS limitations)
3. Open `menu.html` in Chrome or Firefox browsers. IE9/10 still not supported.
